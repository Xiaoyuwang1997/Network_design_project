## Dataset Expanation:
### Dataset is in the folder named 'data'
We choose High school contact and friendship networks( http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/high-school-contact-and-friendship-networks/), which contains 120 nodes as well as 348 edges, and corresponds to the directed network of contacts between students as reported in contact diaries collected at the end of the fourth day of the data collection. Each line has the form “i j w”, meaning that student i reported contacts with student j of aggregate durations of (i) at most 5 min if w = 1, (ii) between 5 and 15 min if w = 2, (iii) between 15 min and 1 h if w = 3, (iv) more than 1 h if w = 4.
